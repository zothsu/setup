# Notes Folder

This folder functions as an Obsidian vault, holding personal documentation and reference material. Each note is stored as a Markdown file, allowing for easy linking and cross-referencing within Obsidian.

## Organization
- Each topic (e.g., server setup, Docker usage, shell tricks) can have its own dedicated note.
- Use `[[]]` links to connect related topics.
- Consider adopting a structure like `00-Inbox`, `01-Resources`, `02-Projects`, etc.

## Linking Examples
- `[[Docker Cheatsheet]]` to link to a Docker reference
- `[[SSH Hardening]]` for secure server notes

## Purpose
- Quick reference of commands
- Documentation for repeated tasks
- Brain dump of server or code ideas
- Archiving solutions to problems encountered

## Guidelines
1. **Keep notes atomic**: focus each note on a single concept or reference.
2. **Use tags** (e.g. `#docker`, `#security`) for easy searching.
3. **Maintain relevant links** so your vault remains navigable.

## Future Improvements
- Add a daily/weekly journal note for capturing ephemeral tasks.
- Create a knowledge graph overview to see how notes interconnect.
- Integrate with version control for historical tracking.

This notes folder is primarily for personal knowledge management. Sensitive information should remain outside or be encrypted within the vault.
